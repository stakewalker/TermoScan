This is a solo-developed prototype to showcase dynamic data visualization, providing industrial plant engineers understanding of thermal trends

It consists in a Python Dash web application created for handling temperature data from diverse sensors, connected to PLC devices (both Siemens and Allen Bradley models) across multiple rooms or plants

Includes the capability to generate PDF reports for both real-time monitoring and historical analysis
