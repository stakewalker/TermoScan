# TermoScan
Presenting a meticulously crafted Python Dash web application tailored for efficient handling of temperature data from diverse sensors and PLC devices across multiple rooms. This solo-developed prototype showcases dynamic data visualization spanning years, providing users with a nuanced understanding of thermal trends

A standout feature includes the capability to generate PDF reports, allowing for seamless integration of company logos for a polished touch. With user-friendly configurability at its core, this application is poised to offer a sophisticated and powerful solution for real-time monitoring and historical analysis

As the sole developer behind this project, I am nearing the completion of the production-ready version. Stay tuned for the official release, promising a robust and intuitive tool for comprehensive temperature data management
